It was my first real important project in python. I dedicate it to my dad,he works in a car workshop.
He always has got lots of clients and to manage easier them I create this program for him.

♥♥♥ FUN FACT = My dad ,actually, never used it due legal purpose. But he appreciated it ♥♥♥

You can edit the code for your activity ;)


I wrote it when i was 13 yr old (December 2020).
